Technology stack: HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, PunkAPI, themoviedb, mysql, github. Some of the elements of this stack such as HTML, CSS, PunkAPI, themoviedb, and github we were going to use regardless because of the important front end services, database, and repo, respectively that these tools provide. We decided to use Python, Flask, and mysql to develop our backend over Javascript and its associated elements primarily because we were more familiar with Python processes and understood that we could complete our objective using that framework.
